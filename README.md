## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/flash-cards.html) of this group project that was made for Mod1 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to build a flashcard game in Javascript.

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. Implement ES6 classes
2. Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP
3. Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
4. Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application

## Features
* A game that runs in the terminal and quizes the user on thier knowledge of array prototype methods

## How does this work?

* After initializing the game, you'll use your arrow keys of up/down to select your answer
* Once you have what you suspect is the correct answer, you'll simple press enter until you run out of questions(30)
* At the end of the game, it'll tally your score and return a percentage of correct guess!

## Project Reflection

##### Wins
* Created game that plays in the terminal running off multiple class to class interactions
* Implementation of ES6 arrow functions and iterator methods

##### Challenges
* The logic for the difficult game.
* trying to create DRY code.

#### Future Features
* Add option for users to redo thier missed questions
